This site started from the idea of buying an expired domain, I logged into Namecheap and placed a bid on a domain I liked, a whole $5 US ($8 AUD), the auction still had a few hours to go so I perused the most expensive bid lists, the cheapest bids and the most ... uh... creative domains on offer.

In Australia, the auctions end at 2am, I was sure my bid couldn't be beaten so I slept soundly as the auction ticked ever closer to closing. I woke up the next morning and groggily looked at my emails. My grogginess quickly turned to horror as I read that I was outbid. How is that possible? Who would do such a thing? I promptly logged into Namecheap to find the offending party who dared challenge my financial stability, I glanced at the auction bids ... my $5 US was no match for their eye-watering bid of $6 US.

Resigned to my defeat, I needed a new strategy, something that didn't require bidding against the high rollers. I scrolled through the various sub sections of the marketplace and found the Buy Now section. Financial ability was thrown out the window to be replaced by a game of skill, a standoff where the one to click their left mouse on the Add to cart button the fastest (and checkout) was the victor. I tweaked the filters and away I went, scrolling the sea of misspelled celebrities, potential copyright infringements, foreclosed banks and law practices, and general useless combinations of random letters, nouns, and adjectives, until I found a domain that wasn't terrible. $8 and another $22 for hosting later and I had a chance to give an old domain new life.
